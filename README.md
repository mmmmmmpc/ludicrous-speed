# GEMINI AI - BASH SCRIPT

## Description

This script is used to automate the process of getting back an AI result from Gemini to the given prompt.

## Requirements

- `bash`
- `jq`
- `curl`
- `fzf`
- A Google Gemini API Key
- Internet connection :-D

## Setup

1. Copy the script `ludicrous-speed.sh` file to a folder in your path like `$HOME/.local/bin`
2. Run `chmod +x ludicrous-speed.sh` to make the file executable
3. (Optional, recommended) Symlink the script to a global location for easy access:
   ```bash
   ln -s /full/path/to/ludicrous-speed.sh $HOME/.local/bin/ai
   # Or, for system-wide (requires sudo):
   sudo ln -s /full/path/to/ludicrous-speed.sh /usr/local/bin/ai
   ```
   Now you can use `ai` from anywhere in your terminal.
4. Obtain a Google Gemini API Key

- Go to Google AI Studio (you might need to log in with your Google account).
- Look for an option like "Get API key" or "Create API key". This might be in a "Gemini API" tab or directly visible.
- You may need to agree to the terms of service.
- Choose to create an API key in a new project or use an existing one.
- Once generated, copy your API key immediately and store it in a safe, private place. Treat it like a password!

5. Provide your GEMINI_API_KEY to the script in one of the following ways:

   - **Recommended:** Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the script with the following content:
     ```env
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
     ```
   - Or, export your GEMINI_API_KEY to the terminal session using `export GEMINI_API_KEY="your api key"`, or add it to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

   > The script will automatically load the `.env` file if it exists. If the API key is not set, it will print an error and exit.

6. Run `ai prompt` or `./ludicrous-speed.sh prompt` to get an AI result

## Usage

### Basic prompt

```bash
ai "What is the best Google product?"
```

### List available models

```bash
ai --list-models
```

### Select a model interactively (requires fzf or will use basic selector)

```bash
ai --select-model "Explain quantum computing"
```

### Streaming output

The script now streams output in real time as it is generated by Gemini, thanks to the streaming API.
